# Grannophone plywood case

This directory contains the plans for a plywood case.

Note that this is a work in progress. Most sheets should be usable already, but may lack information about where to drill holes when using a fretsaw/scrollsaw (the sheets *should* work with a lasercutter, too - feedback welcome!), and where to place screws.

At present, the base model consists of the following sheets:

- scale check - print this first, to check that your printer is printing everything to scale
	- sheet_0.pdf

- telephone hook for the Digitus USB telephone receiver/headset
(in the works: sheets for an OpisTech telephone receiver (with t-coil hearing aid support)
	- sheet_1_digitus.pdf
	- sheet_2_digitus.pdf
	- sheet_3_digitus.pdf - this sheet is needed twice! As with sheets 5 and 6 from the siedle_noamp series, you can simply attach two sheets (good sides facing each other) with masking tape and cut two sheets at the same time.


- base plates to accommodate two Siedle speakers, connected directly to the SBC, no amplifier
(in the works: sheets for larger, potentially amplifier-driven speakers by Visaton, sheets for Siedle amplifier-driven speakers)
	- sheet_4_siedle_noamp.pdf
	- sheet_5_siedle_noamp.pdf
	- sheet_6_siedle_noamp.pdf - place this sheet on top of sheet 5, firmly secure them by wrapping them with masking tape, and start drilling/sawing/filing - this will help reduce splintering, and the affected areas on sheet 5 will be cut out later on anyway.


- currently generic parts
	- sheet_7.pdf
	- sheet_8.pdf

- the back cover isn't finished yet - a full-sized DIN A5 sheet of plywood is currently used in its place.
