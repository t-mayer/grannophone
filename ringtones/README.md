# Grannophone ringtones

This directory contains some sample soundfiles that can be used as ringtones.

They mechanical ringtones were all recorded by Stefan Baur (https://github.com/stefanbaur), using a mechanical cash register bell as the source of the sound.

The spoken "incoming call" messages in German and English (eingehender_anruf_kris_rothe.wav and incoming_call_kris_rothe.wav) were kindly provided by Kristina Rothe (https://www.kristina-rothe.com/).
